    "text": "What is FND\nFunctional neurological disorder (FND) is a condition where there are changes in the functioning of the nervous system (the brain and the spinal cord). This is different to a neurological condition where there is structural damage or changes in the brain or spinal cord. There is no structural damage in functional neurological disorder (FND), but this does not mean that the symptoms are not real. They just have a different cause. Functional neurological disorder (FND) symptoms – or ‘functional neurological symptoms’ - are caused by a disruption in the communication between the nerves of the brain and the body. This disruption is caused by physical and emotional stress that a person is experiencing.\nOne way to think of FND is like a motorway. If the nervous system is functioning normally, the motorway traffic is flowing freely, where everyone is going at a similar speed and not stopping.\nIn FND, it is like there are lots of traffic jams, so the traffic flows for a short while, then it all grinds to a halt, then starts again, then stops, and so on. This will cause intermittent, or irregular, signals from the brain to the body, and therefore causes functional neurological symptoms.",

This means that some people are more sensitive to stress than others. For example, their fight or flight, or freeze response may get triggered more easily (we will explain this further in module 4).\nSome people are ‘performance-driven’ or perfectionists, and want to do really well at things, like their job. Whilst this isn’t a bad thing, focusing on other things in this way can mean you are not listening to your body and pushing through, even when you might be struggling. Others may want to help other people a lot.\n\n\nThe kind of people around you whilst you were growing up\nWe learn how to cope with stress before the age of 10 and this shapes our personality as we get older. For example, we learn coping strategies from the people around us. We learn and copy the way the people around us deal with things, such as stress and illness. We may learn to ‘just get on with it’, to suppress emotions, or to think that emotional or physical difficulties are a sign of weakness.\nThis might mean that we don’t learn how to look after ourselves or rest properly as adults.\n\n\nTrauma\nIf you have experienced trauma at a young age, your nervous system becomes more sensitive to stress.\nThere are many different types of abuse (physical, sexual, emotional), but the most common one that causes FND is emotional abuse.\nEmotional abuse is something that you may not have been aware of. Examples include regular criticism from a parent, high expectations from a parent, or having a parent who is struggling with mental health symptoms.\n\nHave any of these things happened to you before your symptoms started?

    "text": "Modern-day ‘sabretooth tigers’\nThreats are things that your brain thinks will harm you. Threats are also called ‘stressors’ (things that cause your mind and body stress). Threats can be internal or external:\n\nInternal threats are threats that come from inside you, such as difficult thoughts (e.g. “I can’t cope”, “I won’t get better” etc.) and feelings (e.g. stress, loneliness, tiredness, illness etc.).\nExternal threats come from outside of you, such as difficult situations or circumstances (e.g. issues at work, arguments with friends or family, money problems etc.).\n\nAlthough they come in different forms, your brain sees all threats the same and they trigger the fight, flight, or freeze response.\n\nWhere does fight, flight or freeze come from?\n\nIn caveman times, a threat could be a sabretooth tiger. Caveman brains would always need to look out for these types of threats to keep them safe and alive. Coming across threats will trigger the biological fight, flight, or freeze response. This means that blood and oxygen is pumped to the muscles and chemicals in the body, called adrenaline and cortisol, are released. The heart beats faster and our breathing gets faster so that blood and oxygen are directed to the muscles. This helps us to fight danger or run away (flight) from it. After we have got away from the threat, or it has passed, we usually return to a ‘resting and relaxed’ state. If we are unable to get away from the threat, adrenaline and cortisol continue to be released, and we go into the freeze response. This is where we are immobilised to keep us safe from the threat.",

    "section": "FND and the Freeze Response",
    "text": "FND and the Freeze Response\nIn FND, threats create a problem with the communication between the brain and body. The brain processes a threat (an internal threat e.g. pain or “I’m not good enough”, or an external threat e.g. broken-down car or an argument with someone) as the sabretooth tiger. This therefore triggers the fight or flight response. Many people with FND spend a lot of time in the fight or flight response without realising, so much so that it can become “normal”. Any additional threats therefore make the body go into the freeze response. This happens when the person is unable to get away from the threat they are experiencing.\n\nThe Pressure Cooker\nYou could think of your body’s response to stress (or threats) as a pressure cooker. If the temperature of the pressure cooker is kept steady, it doesn’t boil over. Sometimes we might need to remove the lid to let off some steam. If the temperature of the pot rises, a lot of pressure forms inside. Without lowering the temperature, the pot will eventually boil over.\n\nWe can use the pressure cooker to explain how we cope with high levels of stress. If we can’t lower the temperature (manage the stress), the pot will eventually boil over (we enter fight, flight or freeze states).\n\n\nWhat happens when the pressure cooker boils?\nThe types of symptoms that can happen when the freeze response is triggered are fear, pain, dizziness, weakness, numbness, and tingling. At times of extreme stress, the brain goes into shutdown-mode (freeze) which can lead to further functional neurological symptoms, such as paralysis, numbness, eyesight/speech problems, or out-of-body sensations and, functional seizures.\nPsychologists will work with you to create a ‘valve’ to let the steam out of your pressure cooker regularly and in short bursts.\n\nWhat are your sabretooth tigers (threats) that cause you to fight, flight or freeze? Think of some internal threats and external threats that you’ve experienced in the past or present.",

    "text": "The Green Zone\nThe green zone is where you want to spend most of your time. This can be achieved by reducing the amount of time you spend in the amber and red zones, since this is where functional neurological symptoms happen.\nYou can imagine being in the green zone like a seesaw:\n\nThe green zone is balanced and steady when you are not experiencing stress, or you are managing it well. If you experience stress and you’re not managing this well, the seesaw becomes unbalanced and unsteady. This can tip you into the amber or red zone, making you more likely to experience functional neurological symptoms.\n\nReducing the threats that are sending you into the amber and red zones is easier said than done (we will look at this in module 8 onwards). The easiest way to reduce your functional neurological symptoms is to spend as much time as possible doing green zone activities.\nPsychological therapy teaches you skills and strategies that you can practise in your everyday life to help you stay in or get back down to the green zone. Being in the green zone will help you get unstuck. Remember the green zone diagram of thoughts, feelings, behaviours and body sensations you read about in module 5 and 6. This picture shows the types of thoughts, feelings, behaviours and body sensations you can experience in the green zone:\n\nPsychological therapy teaches you skills that help in each of these areas. Here are some examples:\n\nThoughts ➡️ engaging in therapy\nFeelings ➡️ learning to be in the present moment / breathing exercises\nBody sensations ➡️ relaxation techniques\nBehaviours ➡️ looking at lifestyle choices\n\nThere are also everyday activities that you can do to keep yourself in the green zone. These vary between people but can include activities such as:\n\nListening to music\nReading\nExercising\nSpending time in nature\n\n\nDo you do any of the activities listed above? Make a note of any green zone activities that you currently do and any others that you’d like to add to the list. Green zone activities help you to have thoughts, feelings, behaviours and body sensations like the picture above.\n\nThe activities that are suggested in the modules to come are an invitation only, meaning that you do not have to try all of them. We recommend that you try the activities that you feel comfortable doing. You might find that some work better than others for you. It is normal to get distracted when trying new activities and it might take some practice to get used to doing them.\nIf you have any symptoms or physical conditions that might prevent you from trying any of the activities, get in touch with your GP to talk about this first.\nDo not do any activities that you think might make your symptoms worse.",

    "text": "Green zone activities can help to keep your green zone seesaw balanced and steady. This means you are more likely to stay out of the amber and red zones, and you will experience fewer functional neurological symptoms.\nPsychological therapy teaches you green zone activities to help difficult thoughts, feelings, body sensations and behaviours.\n\nThe skills we are offering below are an invitation only. We encourage you to try skills that are safe for you to do so, in order to find skills that suit you best.\n\n\n\nPractice 1: Awareness of your breathing\nStart to notice your breathing. What do you currently notice about your breathing that you weren’t aware of? For example, are you taking short and shallow breaths, or long, deep breaths. You can try this short task to explore this further:\n\nFind a comfortable, quiet space and sit or lie down.\nBecome aware of your breathing.\nStart to breathe in through your nose, and out through either your nose or mouth.\nPlace your hand on your belly and breathe normally.\nNotice if your hand is moving in and out.\n\nIf your hand isn’t moving in and out, you’re likely to be ‘chest breathing’, which is a sign you are in the amber or red zone. If your hand is moving in and out, then you’re belly breathing. When you are in the green zone your belly naturally rises and falls with your in-breath and out-breath.\n\nWhat else did you notice? For example, the speed of your breath (is it fast or slow), the depth of your breath, or the temperature of your breath going in and out of your nose.\n\n\nChoose a day and time when you can try practising this skill. Write this on your calendar or put it in your phone. When you have tried this skill, make some notes about what you experienced, how you felt, and any difficulties that you had (if any).\n\nNow that you have noticed what your normal breath is like, you can practise green zone breathing skills.\n\n\nPractice 2: Diaphragmatic Breathing\nYour diaphragm is a muscle just below your ribs which helps you to breathe. Practising diaphragmatic breathing (also known as ‘belly breathing’) encourages you to take a nice, deep breath. This will help you to enter the green zone and feel more relaxed.\n\nHere’s how to do it:\n\nLie on your back on a flat surface (or in bed) with your knees bent. You can use a pillow under your head and your knees if that’s more comfortable.\nPut one hand on your chest and the other on your belly, just below your ribs.\nBreathe in slowly through your nose, letting the air in deeply, towards your lower belly. The hand on your chest should stay still and the hand on your belly should rise.\nAs you breathe out, let your belly lower. The hand on your belly should move down.\n\nYou can also practise this sitting in a chair, with your knees bent and your shoulders, head and neck relaxed.\n\nChoose a day and time when you can try practising this skill. Write this on your calendar or put it in your phone. When you have tried this skill, make some notes about what you experienced, how you felt, and any difficulties that you had (if any).\n\n\n\nPractice 3: Square Breathing\nIf you feel able to, you can also practise the ‘Square Breathing’ activity. This will encourage your body to be more relaxed and to do slower, more controlled breathing, which is what we do when we are in the green zone. This is a good skill to practise if you’re noticing that you’re in the amber zone and want to try to bring yourself down to the green zone. If you find 4 seconds difficult, try lowering the time, for example 3 seconds or 2 seconds.\n\nBreathe in for 4 seconds\nHold breath for 4 seconds\nBreathe out for 4 seconds\nHold for 4 seconds\nRepeat.\n\n\nTo help yourself feel even more relaxed, you could try practising making your out-breath longer. There are different variations of this skill, depending on what works best for you:\n\nBreathe in for 2 seconds\nBreathe out for 4 seconds\nRepeat.\n\nOr\n\nBreathe in for 3 seconds\nBreathe out for 6 seconds\nRepeat.\n\nOr\n\nBreathe in for 4 seconds\nBreathe out for 8 seconds\nRepeat.\n\n\nChoose a day and time when you can try practising this skill. Write this on your calendar or put it in your phone. When you have tried this skill, make some notes about what you experienced, how you felt, and any difficulties that you had (if any).",

    "text": "Awareness of your breath\nDiaphragmatic breathing (belly breathing)\nSquare breathing (or variations of this).\n\n\nPractice 1: Being in the present moment\nOne of the main parts of being in the green zone is to be in the present moment. Difficult thoughts and feelings can often pull us away from the present moment and we get caught up in the whirlwind of them. This whirlwind of difficult thoughts and feelings might then influence the decisions you make and the things that you do. Being in the present moment means you are more in control of these decisions and can be guided by what is important to you instead.\nThere are lots of different strategies you can practise to help you be in the present moment. Here is an example - you can play the audio clip or follow the script below:\nFind a comfortable, upright position, and either close your eyes or gently focus on a spot in front of you. Now take a deep breath to bring yourself into the ‘here and now’ [pause], just noticing whatever you are experiencing right now. Can you notice any sensations that you have, like discomfort or tension. Try to notice your feet on the ground, or, if you’re sitting, notice whatever you are sitting on; notice your clothes against your body and the air against the skin. [Pause five seconds.]\nAnd now, notice whatever is in your mind. Whatever thoughts are here, and as best you can, just observe your thoughts as they are in your mind right now. [Pause.] Now notice whatever you are feeling emotionally. Don’t try to change it, but just notice how you are feeling. [Pause five seconds.]\nAnd now, bring your attention to your breath, just noticing the rise and fall of your stomach as you breathe in [pause], and as you breathe out. [Pause five seconds.] Notice the cool air flowing in through your nose as you inhale and the warm air as you exhale [pause], as you breathe in and out. [Pause.]\nIf you find your mind getting distracted from your breath, that’s okay. Simply bring it back to noticing each breath in, and out, as they follow, one after the other. [Pause five seconds.]\nNow bring your attention back to the room; open your eyes if they are closed. Notice what you can see; notice what you can hear. Push your feet into the ground and have a stretch; notice yourself stretching. Welcome back!\n\nChoose a day and time when you can try practising this skill. Write this on your calendar or put it in your phone. When you have tried this skill, make some notes about what you experienced, how you felt, and any difficulties that you had (if any).\n\n\n\nPractice 2: Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR)\nFight, flight or freeze gets your muscles to react quickly to a threat. This can make your muscles feel very tight and tense when you are experiencing lots of threats, and therefore lots of fight, flight or freeze.\nPMR guides you to tense and then relax your muscles one by one. If you feel able to, you can play the audio clip or follow the script below. Practise PMR during the day.\nFind yourself a quiet place to relax. For this relaxation, you can either sit or lie down. Close your eyes if you feel comfortable to do so, or softly hold your gaze at a spot in the room you’re in. Let your hands rest loosely in your lap, or by your side. Become aware of your breathing, and notice how your belly rises and falls with each breath (Pause for 5 seconds).\nNow take a long, slow, deep breath in through your nose, all the way down into your belly. Hold the breath for a moment, and then breathe out through your mouth. Take another slow breath in through your nose. Fill your lungs completely. Hold it for a moment… and breathe out through your mouth. Empty your lungs completely. Take a third deep breath in. Hold it for a moment, and then let it go. You might notice that the tension in your body has already started to loosen.\nDuring this relaxation, you will be asked to tense different muscles in your body. Please do this without straining. Just tense each muscle firmly but gently as you breathe in. If you feel uncomfortable at any time, try to relax and breathe normally.\nBring your awareness to your feet and toes. Breathe in deeply through your nose, and as you do, gradually curl your toes down and tense the muscles in the soles of your feet. Hold your breath for just a few seconds and then relax the muscles in your feet as you breathe out. Feel the tension in your feet wash away as you breathe out. Notice how different your feet feel when tensed and when they are relaxed.\nTake a deep breath in, and tense the muscles in your thighs. Hold for just a moment, and then release everything. As you do this, blood will flow to your muscles, and you may notice a warm tingling sensation.\nNow bring your awareness to your stomach. Take in a nice deep breath and then tighten these muscles. Imagine you are trying to touch your belly button to your spine. Now let go of your breath and let your muscles relax. Notice the sensation of relief that comes from letting go.\nBring your awareness to the muscles in your back. As you slowly breathe in, arch your back slightly and tighten these muscles…. Now breathe out and let your muscles relax.\nNow give your attention to your shoulder muscles and the muscles in your neck. As you slowly draw in a nice deep breath, pull your shoulders up towards your ears and squeeze these muscles firmly. Now breathe out completely, and allow your contracted muscles to go loose and limp.\nNow it’s time to let go of all the tension in your arms and hands. Let’s start with your upper arms. As you breathe in, raise your wrists towards your shoulders and tighten the muscles in your upper arms. Hold that breath and that contraction for just a moment…and then gently lower your arms and breathe all the way out. You may feel a warm sensation in your muscles when you tighten them.\nContinue to focus on your breathing for as long as you like. When you are ready, slowly open your eyes if they are closed and bring your attention back to the area around you. Welcome back!\n\nChoose a day and time when you can try practising this skill. Write this on your calendar or put it in your phone. When you have tried this skill, make some notes about what you experienced, how you felt, and any difficulties that you had (if any).\n\n\n\nPractice 3: Body Scan\nA ‘body scan’ will bring your awareness to what areas of your body feel comfortable and what areas feel uncomfortable. Knowing what feels uncomfortable and tense is the first step to being able to relax these areas. If you feel able to, you can play the audio clip or follow the script below. Practise body scans at bedtime, as it can be helpful when you’re trying to get to sleep.\nFind yourself a quiet place to relax. For this relaxation, you can either sit or lie down. Close your eyes if you feel comfortable to do so, or softly hold your gaze at a spot in the room you’re in. Let your shoulders drop down and away from your ears. Bring your attention to your breathing. Breathe in… and out… (Pause 5 seconds).\nThis exercise is to notice the different feelings in your body. It is not about whether these feelings are good or bad.\nTake a deep breath in through your nose, filling your lungs with air and feeling your belly rise. Hold this for a moment. Breathe out through your mouth and empty your lungs, feeling your belly fall.\nScan your left foot for any sensations. Just become aware of them. (Pause) Then scan your lower left leg. Notice and allow any sensations that might be there. (Pause) Then scan your upper left leg. (Pause) If you don’t feel anything, that’s okay. If you do become aware of tension or any other uncomfortable feeling in a particular part of your body, see if you can breathe into it. To do this, take a breath in and bring your awareness to the sensation, without trying to change it.\nNow scan your right foot (pause), lower right leg (pause), then upper right leg. (Pause) Just try to notice any sensations and feel what is happening. Try to bring a gentle curiosity to the sensations. (Pause)\nIf your mind has wandered and got distracted, this is completely normal. Gently notice this and bring your attention back to the body part you were focusing on.\nNow focus on your belly. Feel it rising as you breathe in. Sinking as you breathe out. Your heart beat may get slower. This is normal. (Pause)\nNow scan for any sensations in your left hand and arm. (Pause) Try to become aware of the different sensations and feel what is happening. Keep bringing an awareness and a curiosity to the sensations. Again, if you don’t feel anything at the moment, that’s okay.\nScan for any sensations in your right hand and arm. (Pause)\nThen scan up along your neck and to your face. Feel the sensations in your jaw and your throat. (Pause)\nNow bring your awareness to the top of your head. (Pause) Take a moment to notice how all of your body parts are connected.\nLet any sensations just be. Just notice what kind of sensation it is – tingling, warmth, coolness, heaviness, floating. Try to accept whatever sensation there is. (Pause)\nContinue to focus on your breathing for as long as you like. When you are ready, slowly open your eyes if they are closed and bring your attention back to the area around you. Welcome back!\n\nChoose a day and time when you can try practising this skill. Write this on your calendar or put it in your phone. When you have tried this skill, make some notes about what you experienced, how you felt, and any difficulties that you had (if any).\n\n\n\nPractice 4: The Five Senses\nYou can use this skill to bring you back to the present moment, particularly if you do not want to focus on what is going on internally in your body. For example, if focusing on what is going on in your body tends to trigger a seizure for you, try this skill instead of Progressive Muscle Relaxation and Body Scan.\nWhat are 5 things that you can see? Look around you and notice 5 things that you hadn’t noticed before. Maybe a pattern on a wall, light reflecting from a surface, or a knick-knack in the corner of a room.\nWhat are 4 things that you can feel? Maybe you can feel the pressure of your feet on the floor, your shirt resting on your shoulders, or the temperature of the air on your skin. Pick up an object and notice its texture.\nWhat are 3 things that you can hear? Notice all the background sounds you had been filtering out, such as air-conditioning, birds chirping, or cars on a distant street.\nWhat are 2 things that you can smell? Maybe you can smell flowers, coffee, or freshly cut grass. It doesn’t have to be a nice smell either.\nWhat is 1 thing that you can taste? Pop a piece of gum in your mouth, sip a drink, eat a snack if you have one, or simply notice how your mouth tastes. ‘Taste’ the air to see how it feels on your tongue.\n\nChoose a day and time when you can try practising this skill. Write this on your calendar or put it in your phone. When you have tried this skill, make some notes about what you experienced, how you felt, and any difficulties that you had (if any).\n\n\n\nPractice 5: Smartphone Apps\nThe apps below have different types of relaxation and being in the present moment exercises that can help you feel more relaxed, spend more time in the green zone, get better sleep, and help you improve your productivity and focus. These apps can be downloaded for free but you can subscribe for full content access.",

This is called the negativity bias. When we are in the amber or red zone, we have a tendency to experience different types of thinking errors. This can show up as anxious or worrying thoughts.\nHere are some examples of thinking errors. Tick if you experience any of them:\n\nBeing aware of these types of thinking errors can help you identify and name them. You can then practise saying positive, reassuring thoughts to yourself. For example:\n\nThis is anxiety\nIt will pass\nI will be fine\nI am capable\n\nBy doing this, you’re not fighting or flighting from the thought. Instead, you’re making friends with it and allowing it to ‘just be’ until it passes.\nImagine these difficult thoughts like clouds in the sky. Try to let your thoughts pass like passing clouds in the sky, not getting caught up in them.\nAnother helpful way to think about this is to consider what a close friend would say to you in the same situation. You could consider taking this advice and be guided by this instead of the whirlwind of difficult thoughts.",

    "text": "Overthinking\nAnother common habit that we can get into when we’re in the amber zone is overthinking. This is where we go round and round in circles of thinking about the same thing, without reaching a conclusion. If we carry on overthinking, the body registers it as a threat and takes us into the red zone, making it more likely for functional neurological symptoms to occur. A simple strategy for reducing overthinking is to intentionally set aside a “worry period”. This is a pre-planned time of day, e.g. 15 minutes at 6pm, where you let yourself worry as much as you like about the thing you are concerned about. At any other time during the day when you notice yourself starting to worry, use one of the breath or being in the present moment techniques we have already introduced.\n\nChoose a day and time when you can try practising this skill. Write this on your calendar or put it in your phone. When you have tried this skill, make some notes about what you experienced, how you felt, and any difficulties that you had (if any).\n\n\nUnderstanding Your Behaviour\nDeveloping new ways of doing things that matter to us, even if we have stopped doing those things, is another important skill to practise. Rather than changing your current behaviours, you can generate and learn new ones.\nCycle of unhelpful behaviours:\n\nDoing what matters to you and being in the present moment:\n\nThis means doing things that feel difficult or that we are avoiding. The key is to do them in small steps. That is why the process of goal setting is helpful.",

Particularly if you are someone who tends to ‘overdo it’.\nSome people do lots of activity, like chores and household jobs, on days where they feel better. This might lead to a big ‘crash’ the day after because you have gone into the red zone and it can make functional neurological symptoms much worse.\nWe can do something called ‘pacing’ to try to stop this from happening. Pacing helps us to not overdo it. Imagine your energy is like a phone battery. It takes a lot of time to charge up the battery when it has run out. It takes less time to top up the battery charge when you have only used the phone a little bit. Try to not use up all your energy and take lots of breaks so that your energy stays topped up.\n\n\n‘Time’ Not ‘Task’\nIf you have things to do, plan to do them in time slots. Give yourself a manageable time slot to complete the task and then take a break. If you don’t get the task done, that’s okay. It is better to do the task is smaller time slots than use up all your energy getting it done at once. Otherwise it can make your functional neurological symptoms worse.",
