  abstract = {Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) were first described in the medical literature in the 19th century, as seizure-like attacks not related to an identified central nervous system lesion, and are currently classified as a conversion disorder, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5). While a universally accepted and unifying etiological model does not yet exist, several risk factors have been identified. Management of PNES should be based on interdisciplinary collaboration, targeting modifiable risk factors. The first treatment phase in PNES is patient engagement, which is challenging given the demonstrated low rates of treatment retention. Acute interventions constitute the next phase in treatment, and most research studies focus on short-term evidence-based interventions. Randomized controlled pilot trials support cognitive\textendash behavioral therapy. Other psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological interventions have been less well-studied using controlled and uncontrolled trials. Within the discussion of acute interventions, we present a preliminary evaluation for feasibility of a mindfulness-based psychotherapy protocol in a very small sample of PNES patients. We demonstrated in 6 subjects that this intervention is feasible in real-life clinical scenarios and warrants further investigation in larger scale studies. The final treatment phase is long-term follow-up. Long-term outcome studies in PNES show that a significant proportion of patients remains symptomatic and experiences continued impairments in quality of life and functionality. We believe that PNES should be understood as a disease that requires different types of intervention during the various phases of treatment.},

  abstract = {Background: Mindfulness-based therapies (MBTs) are effective in many neuropsychiatric disorders, and represent a potential therapeutic strategy for psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES). Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the clinical effect of a manualized 12-session MBT for PNES in an uncontrolled trial. We hypothesized reductions in PNES frequency, intensity, and duration, and improvements in quality of life and psychiatric symptom severity at treatment completion. Methods: Between August 2014 and February 2018, 49 patients with documented PNES (with video electroencephalography [EEG]) were recruited at Brigham and Women's Hospital to participate in the MBT for PNES treatment study. Baseline demographic and clinical information and self-rating scales were obtained during the diagnostic evaluation (T0). Baseline PNES frequency, intensity, and duration were collected at the first followup postdiagnosis (T1). Frequency was obtained at each subsequent MBT session and analyzed over time with median regression analysis. Outcomes for other measures were collected at the last MBT session (T3), and compared to baseline measures using linear mixed models. Results: Twenty-six patients completed the 12-session MBT program and were included in the analysis. Median PNES frequency decreased by 0.12 events/week on average with each successive MBT session (p = 0.002). At session 12, 70\% of participants endorsed a reduction in PNES frequency of at least 50\%. Freedom from PNES was reported by 50\% of participants by treatment conclusion. Seventy percent reported a 50\% reduction in frequency from baseline and 50\% reported remission at session 12. By treatment end, PNES intensity decreased (p = 0.012) and quality of life improved (p = 0.002). Event duration and psychiatric symptom severity were lower after treatment, but reductions were not statistically significant. Conclusions: Completion of a manualized 12-session MBT for PNES provides improvement in PNES frequency, intensity, and quality of life. The high dropout rate is consistent with adherence studies in PNES. Possible reasons for dropout are discussed. Randomized controlled trials and longer-term outcomes are needed to demonstrate the efficacy of MBT in PNES.},

Preliminary evidence supports the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) approaches, and CBT-based group therapies have the potential to improve cost-effectiveness and deliverability of treatment. This pilot study was undertaken to evaluate whether CBT-based group therapy would offer a feasible treatment option for patients with NEAs and other FNSs. We evaluated the outcomes of an information and management intervention within a neuropsychiatry service, which included weekly CBT-based group therapy sessions for patients with NEAs and other FNSs. Outcomes pertaining to quality of life and physical and emotional well-being were measured using the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale. Data were collected from 16 patients, of whom 10 presented with NEAs. Significant improvements were selectively reported in the `emotional well-being' (p=0.04) and `role limitation due to emotional well-being' (p=0.04) subscores of the SF-36. Improvements in overall quality-of-life scores (p=0.22), as well as in HADS anxiety (p=0.34) and depression (p=0.46) scores, did not reach statistical significance. These trends were supported by a positive mean CGI improvement scale score of 2.4, indicating minimal-to-considerable improvement. Group therapy intervention with a CBT-based approach is a feasible treatment option in the management of NEAs and other FNSs, as shown by significant improvements in emotional domains of quality of life in this low power pilot study.},

A small number of psychoeducation treatments have been evaluated, with promising results. As part of routine care within a neuropsychiatry service, a 3-session cognitive-behavior therapy- (CBT-) informed psychoeducation group was developed. Patients with comorbid epilepsy were included. The group's effectiveness was evaluated in terms of attack frequency, mood, illness perception, dissociative experiences, and patient feedback. Pre- and post-treatment data were obtained for 19 patients. The proportion of patients experiencing attacks significantly decreased, with almost 40\% of treatment completers reporting being attack-free at the end of treatment. Significant improvements were also found on level of psychological distress, illness beliefs, and understanding of the condition. No significant changes in mood or general functioning were observed. High satisfaction was reported by almost all patients. Treatment outcome was not significantly affected by the level of dissociative experiences. The results suggest that CBT-based psychoeducation group treatment can be a beneficial part of treatment for those with FNEA, even for those experiencing high levels of dissociation. Further controlled studies with larger sample sizes are required.},

Methods This retrospective study describes patients seen between 2010 and 2016 at the epilepsy clinic at Glostrup University Hospital in Denmark and offered a psychotherapeutic treatment program for PNES. Forty-two patients were interviewed about seizure outcome 12\textendash 24\,months after psychotherapy, and the annual changes in healthcare utilization and associated costs of services provided in a period of 24\,months before and up to 24\,months after treatment were compared. Results At 12-month follow-up, 83\% of the patients had achieved above 50\% reduction in seizures. The 24-month pretreatment costs compared with the 24-month posttreatment costs directly associated with seizures dropped by 95.8\%, and total healthcare costs were reduced by 63\%. Estimation of annual savings from the program comes to 1060 \texteuro{} per patient. An association was found between seizure rate and number of healthcare contacts. Conclusion This study adds to the evidence that psychotherapy is a cost-effective way of treating PNES. The economic benefits from this form of intervention appear not only to diminish costs directly associated with PNES, but also healthcare utilization in general.},

Background:  Although suggestions have been made concerning the management of patients with dissociative seizures, no studies have previously evaluated the systematic use of cognitive behavioral therapy in the treatment of this disorder. Method:  Twenty patients diagnosed with dissociative seizures were offered treatment comprising 12 sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy. Principal outcome measures were dissociative seizure frequency and psychosocial functioning, including improvement in employment status and mood. Measures were administered before treatment, at the end of treatment, and at a 6-month follow-up. Results:  Treatment was completed by 16 patients (questionnaire measures were not available for 4 patients who discontinued treatment). Following treatment, there was a highly significant reduction in seizure frequency and an improvement in self-rated psychosocial functioning. These improvements were maintained at the 6-month follow-up. There was also a tendency for patients to have improved their employment status between the start of treatment and the 6-month follow-up period. Conclusions:  In this open prospective trial, cognitive behavioral therapy was associated with a reduction in dissociative seizure frequency and an improvement in psychosocial functioning in adults with dissociative seizures.},

  abstract = {Objective: To compare cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and standard medical care (SMC) as treatments for psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES). Methods: Our randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared CBT with SMC in an outpatient neuropsychiatric setting. Sixty-six PNES patients were randomized to either CBT (plus SMC) or SMC alone, scheduled to occur over 4 months. PNES diagnosis was established by video-EEG telemetry for most patients. Exclusion criteria included comorbid history of epilepsy, Ͻ2 PNES/month, and IQ Ͻ70. The primary outcome was seizure frequency at end of treatment and at 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes included 3 months of seizure freedom at 6-month follow-up, measures of psychosocial functioning, health service use, and employment. Results: In an intention-to-treat analysis, seizure reduction following CBT was superior at treatment end (group ϫ time interaction p Ͻ 0.0001; large to medium effect sizes). At follow-up, the CBT group tended to be more likely to have experienced 3 months of seizure freedom (odds ratio 3.125, p ϭ 0.086). Both groups improved in some health service use measures and on the Work and Social Adjustment Scale. Mood and employment status showed no change. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that cognitive-behavioral therapy is more effective than standard medical care alone in reducing seizure frequency in PNES patients. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class III evidence that CBT in addition to SMC, as compared to SMC alone, significantly reduces seizure frequency in patients with PNES (change in median monthly seizure frequency: baseline to 6 months follow-up, CBT group, 12 to 1.5; SMC alone group, 8 to 5).

The prognosis is unfavourable and there are no generally accepted treatment protocols. Method: In this study, the effect of an uncontrolled, prospective inpatient treatment program for PNES patients is evaluated. The treatment is multidisciplinary and based on cognitive behavioural principles. Seizure control, general psychopathology, anxiety, depression, coping, dissociation and health related quality of life are evaluated. Twenty-two patients participated in the study of which 16 patients were followed 6 months after treatment. Results: After follow-up, 81\% of patients had a seizure reduction of over 50\%, and half of them became seizure-free. Measures of anxiety, depression and dissociation tended to normalize, coping was more adequate and health related quality of life was increased slightly. In the period between the end of treatment and follow-up the most positive effects are maintained and even strengthened. Patients who became seizure-free at follow-up improved more on the psychological outcome measures than patients with continuing seizures. Conclusion: The outcome suggests effectiveness of the treatment. PNES patients may profit from a comprehensive, multidisciplinary treatment program following cognitive behavioural principles. Seizure cessation appears to be an important factor in the improvement of psychological functioning.},

  abstract = {Purpose Psychotherapy is recommended in patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES). To date, however, a limited number of studies have attempted to assess the long-term effectiveness of psychotherapy in patients with PNES. Here, we report the short and six-month follow-up seizure and psychopathological outcomes in patients with PNES who have undergone a combination of cognitive\textendash behavioral individual and group therapy. Methods In this prospective, naturalistic study, 80 patients with PNES underwent cognitive behavioral psychotherapy in an inpatient setting (mean duration: 64.5\,days) and were evaluated prior to treatment (T1) and at its end (T2). Six months after treatment, 55 patients participated in the follow-up assessment (T3). Psychopathology questionnaires and PNES ratings were used at T1, T2, and T3 to determine outcomes. Results At T2, 23\% of the patients were free from PNES for {$\geq$}2\,weeks. At T3, 21.8\% were seizure-free for {$\geq$}1\,month and 10.9\% for {$\geq$}3\,months. Only two patients who were free from PNES at T2 remained free from PNES until T3. Ten further patients achieved seizure freedom during the follow-up period and were free from seizures for {$\geq$}1\,month at T3. Nevertheless, a subjective improvement of the seizure situation was reported by 74.1\% of the patients. Patients' psychopathology scores decreased from T1 to T2 and remained stable after discharge (except for a slight increase of depression score from T2 to T3). Those patients who were PNES-free at T3 had less severe psychopathology, experienced less traumatic events, and PNES were prolonged prior to treatment than those who did not become seizure-free. Significance Inpatient psychotherapy led to PNES freedom in a minority of patients. Pretreatment psychopathology was the key factor affecting six-month follow-up seizure outcomes. Expectations should be formed in accordance with these perspectives, i.e., seizure freedom is difficult to achieve in many patients, but psychotherapy may be useful to treat underlying psychopathology. As our results stem from a specific patient sample (i.e., patients with chronic and refractory PNES) treated in a very specific setting, the generalizability of our findings is limited.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To evaluate different PNES treatments compared with standard medical care (treatment as usual). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Pilot randomized clinical trial at 3 academic medical centers with mental health clinicians trained to administer psychotherapy or psychopharmacology to outpatients with PNES. Thirty-eight participants were randomized in a blocked schedule among 3 sites to 1 of 4 treatment arms and were followed up for 16 weeks between September 2008 and February 2012; 34 were included in the analysis. INTERVENTIONS Medication (flexible-dose sertraline hydrochloride) only, cognitive behavioral therapy informed psychotherapy (CBT-ip) only, CBT-ip with medication (sertraline), or treatment as usual. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Seizure frequency was the primary outcome; psychosocial and functioning measures, including psychiatric symptoms, social interactions, quality of life, and global functioning, were secondary outcomes. Data were collected prospectively, weekly, and with baseline, week 2, midpoint (week 8), and exit (week 16) batteries. Within-group analyses for each arm were performed on primary (seizure frequency) and secondary outcomes from treatment-blinded raters using an intention-to-treat analysis. RESULTS The psychotherapy (CBT-ip) arm showed a 51.4\% seizure reduction (P = .01) and significant improvement from baseline in secondary measures including depression, anxiety, quality of life, and global functioning (P {$<$} .001). The combined arm (CBT-ip with sertraline) showed 59.3\% seizure reduction (P = .008) and significant improvements in some secondary measures, including global functioning (P = .007). The sertraline-only arm did not show a reduction in seizures (P = .08). The treatment as usual group showed no significant seizure reduction or improvement in secondary outcome measures (P = .19). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This pilot randomized clinical trial for PNES revealed significant seizure reduction and improved comorbid symptoms and global functioning with CBT-ip for PNES without and with sertraline. There were no improvements in the sertraline-only or treatment-as-usual arms. This study supports the use of manualized psychotherapy for PNES and successful training of mental health clinicians in the treatment. Future studies could assess larger-scale intervention dissemination.},

This prospective multicentre study describes a psycho-educational intervention for PNES building on the initial communication of the diagnosis and examines the feasibility of its delivery by healthcare professionals with minimal experience in psychological therapies. Method: Three healthcare professionals with minimal training in psychological therapies took part in a one-day training course. 20 participants attended for a four-session manualised psycho-educational intervention delivered at three different clinical neuroscience centres. Participants completed selfreport measures prior to the intervention at baseline (n = 29) and seven months after diagnosis (n = 13) measures included seizure frequency, health related quality of life, healthcare utilisation, activity levels, symptom attributions and levels of functioning. Therapy sessions were audiorecorded and manual adherence assessed. Results: Of 29 patients enrolled into the study, 20 started and 13 completed the intervention and provided follow-up information. At follow-up, 4/13 of patients had achieved complete seizure control and a further 3/13 reported a greater than 50\% improvement in seizure frequency. After training, epilepsy nurses and assistant psychologists demonstrated sufficient adherence to the manualised psycho-educational intervention in 80\% of sessions. Conclusion: The delivery of our brief manualised psycho-educational intervention for PNES by health professionals with minimal training in psychological treatment was feasible. The intervention was associated with higher rates of PNES cessation than those observed in our previous studies describing the short-term outcome of the communication of the diagnosis alone. An RCT of the intervention is justified but a significant proportion of drop-outs will have to be anticipated.},

Methods: 23 patients displaying PNES were randomly assigned to a group receiving BPT for 6 months, a group receiving CBT for 6 months and a control group no receiving psychotherapy. Presence of PNES was confirmed by electroencephalography (EEG). To assess self-perception quality of life, the QOLIE-31 questionnaire was applied before and every three months including a six months' follow-up after treatment ended. Results: PNES frequency decreased significantly after the first three months of both therapies compared to control group. No differences were observed when the two therapies were compared. The significant decrease of PNES frequency remains until six months after the end of psychotherapy. Concerning self-perceived quality of life, QOLIE-31 results indicate a significant improvement since the first three months. At the beginning all the patients report a poor quality of life. After three months of psychotherapy most of them improve to a normal quality of life. After 6 months of therapy patients showed values reflecting an excellent quality of life, remaining at these levels six months after therapies ended. Conclusion: The present results support the notion that both psychotherapeutic approaches are reliably procedures for decrease PNES frequency and improve quality of life in these patients.},

It was hypothesized that patients would experience improvements in their understanding of PNES, illness perception and affective scores, but might not necessarily experience a significant change in post-traumatic and dissociative symptoms and in seizure frequency. Methods: This study included 12 patients (10 women, 2 men) who were invited to participate in a psychoeducational group after receiving a V-EEG confirmed diagnosis of PNES. The group consisted of 3 sessions lasting 2 h each. Pre and post measures included Psychoeducational Intervention Questionnaire, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory-II, Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Diagnostic Scale 5, Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES-M). Results: This psychoeducational intervention produced results that were similar to interventions reported in US and European studies with regard to changes on psychological measures. Moreover, many patients also reported (on the final day of the intervention) a decrease in seizure frequency. All patients reported that participating in the intervention was a positive experience. Also, all but one patient referred that the participation in the group would have a positive impact on their quality of life. Conclusions: Psychoeducational interventions appear to have had positive results in Argentinian patients with PNES.

Current treatment gaps highlight the need for time-limited, distance-delivered interventions that can be cost-effectively delivered to patients with PNES. Project UPLIFT is a selfmanagement program addressing mood problems in epilepsy that has not previously been adapted for PNES. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of UPLIFT for patients with PNES. Methods: Project UPLIFT was minimally adapted by a multidisciplinary research group at DartmouthHitchcock Medical Center. Participants were recruited into a nonrandomized pilot study and were assessed at baseline, after completing the intervention, and at 1-month follow-up. Results: The intervention was adapted and delivered without additional modification. A total of eight participants enrolled in the trial, and six participated in the first session. All six participants who started UPLIFT completed the intervention, with a 98\% attendance record across the eight sessions. At followup, 100\% reported that UPLIFT provided useful tools for daily life. All participants continued using UPLIFT after completing the program, and 83\% felt it helped with seizure management. Preliminary results provide proof-of-concept for future efficacy trials. Conclusion: This study provides initial support for the feasibility and acceptability of Project UPLIFT, minimally adapted for patients with PNES. As a time-limited program that can be distance-delivered to groups of patients, UPLIFT may be well-suited for the healthcare environment brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.},

The study included patients from four centers, using a manualized psychoeducation intervention delivered over 4 sessions by specialist epilepsy nurses and assistant psychologists. All patients completed self-measure questionnaires for Seizure Frequency, Impaired Functioning (WSAS), Psychological Distress (CORE-OM), Illness Perception (BIPQ), Health-Related Quality of Life: general (ED-QOL) and epilepsy-specific (NewQOL-6D), Symptom Attribution, and patient's perception of usefulness and relevance of the intervention. All measures were collected at baseline and after the completion of the fourth session. Results: All measures improved from baseline to postintervention, but this improvement was only significant for CORE-OM (p b .05) and BIPQ (p b .01). Out of the 25 patients who completed the intervention information, 6 out of 25 (24\%) had been seizure-free for the past month, and an additional 6 out of 25 (24\%) had achieved seizure frequency reduction. Consequently, upon completion of the intervention, 12 out of 25 patients (48\%) were either seizure-free or experienced fewer seizures compared with the start of the intervention. Conclusion: The evidence suggests that brief manualized psychoeducation intervention can reduce PNES frequency, improve the psychological distress, and have an effect on patients' illness perceptions that should help them engage with a more extended psychotherapy program if that was necessary. The intervention was carried out successfully by staff with relatively little training in delivering psychological interventions.

Seizure frequency and questionnaire responses were examined pre- and posttreatment in all 7 of 10 individuals who completed the majority of the psychoeducational sessions.
