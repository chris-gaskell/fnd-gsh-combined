This critical review aims to guide clinicians through the use of performance validity tests (PVTs) from test selection and administration through test interpretation and feedback. Method/results: Recommended cutoffs and relevant test operating characteristics are presented. Other important issues to consider during test selection, administration, interpretation, and feedback are discussed including order effects, coaching, impact on test data, and methods to combine measures and improve predictive power. When interpreting performance validity measures, neuropsychologists must use particular caution in cases of dementia, low intelligence, English as a second language/ minority cultures, or low education. Conclusions: PVTs provide valuable information regarding response bias and, under the right circumstances, can provide excellent evidence of response bias. Only after consideration of the entire clinical picture, including validity test performance, can concrete determinations regarding the validity of test data be made.},

  abstract = {Performance validity tests (PVTs) are used to measure the validity of the obtained neuropsychological test data. However, when an individual fails a PVT, the likelihood that failure truly reflects invalid performance (i.e., the positive predictive value) depends on the base rate in the context in which the assessment takes place. Therefore, accurate base rate information is needed to guide interpretation of PVT performance. This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the base rate of PVT failure in the clinical population (PROSPERO number: CRD42020164128). PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and PsychINFO were searched to identify articles published up to November 5, 2021. Main eligibility criteria were a clinical evaluation context and utilization of stand-alone and well-validated PVTs. Of the 457 articles scrutinized for eligibility, 47 were selected for systematic review and meta-analyses. Pooled base rate of PVT failure for all included studies was 16\%, 95\% CI [14, 19]. High heterogeneity existed among these studies (Cochran's Q\,=\,697.97, p\,{$<$}\,.001; I2\,=\,91\%; {$\tau$}2\,=\,0.08). Subgroup analysis indicated that pooled PVT failure rates varied across clinical context, presence of external incentives, clinical diagnosis, and utilized PVT. Our findings can be used for calculating clinically applied statistics (i.e., positive and negative predictive values, and likelihood ratios) to increase the diagnostic accuracy of performance validity determination in clinical evaluation. Future research is necessary with more detailed recruitment procedures and sample descriptions to further improve the accuracy of the base rate of PVT failure in clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Much attention in the field of clinical neuropsychology has focused on adapting to the modern healthcare environment by advancing telehealth and promoting technological innovation in assessment. Perhaps as important (but less discussed) are advances in the development and interpretation of normative neuropsychological test data. These techniques can yield improvement in diagnostic decision-making and treatment planning with little additional cost. Brooks and colleagues (Can Psychol 50: 196\textendash 209, 2009) eloquently summarized best practices in normative data creation and interpretation, providing a practical overview of norm development, measurement error, the base rates of low scores, and methods for assessing change. Since the publication of this seminal work, there have been several important advances in research on development and interpretation of normative neuropsychological test data, which may be less familiar to the practicing clinician. Specifically, we provide a review of the literature on regression-based normed scores, item response theory, multivariate base rates, summary/factor scores, cognitive intraindividual variability, and measuring change over time. For each topic, we include (1) an overview of the method, (2) a rapid review of the recent literature, (3) a relevant case example, and (4) a discussion of limitations and controversies. Our goal was to provide a primer for use of normative neuropsychological test data in neuropsychological practice.},

  abstract = {Regression equations have many useful roles in psychological assessment. Moreover, there is a large reservoir of published data that could be used to build regression equations; these equations could then be employed to test a wide variety of hypotheses concerning the functioning of individual cases. This resource is currently underused because (a) not all psychologists are aware that regression equations can be built not only from raw data but also using only basic summary data for a sample, and (b) the computations involved are tedious and prone to error. In an attempt to overcome these barriers, Crawford and Garthwaite (2007) provided methods to build and apply simple linear regression models using summary statistics as data. In the present study, we extend this work to set out the steps required to build multiple regression models from sample summary statistics and the further steps required to compute the associated statistics for drawing inferences concerning an individual case. We also develop, describe, and make available a computer program that implements these methods. Although there are caveats associated with the use of the methods, these need to be balanced against pragmatic considerations and against the alternative of either entirely ignoring a pertinent data set or using it informally to provide a clinical ``guesstimate.'' Upgraded versions of earlier programs for regression in the single case are also provided; these add the point and interval estimates of effect size developed in the present article.},

  abstract = {The interpretation of psychometric test results is usually based on norm scores. We compared semiparametric continuous norming (SPCN) with conventional norming methods by simulating results for test scales with different item numbers and difficulties via an item response theory approach. Subsequently, we modeled the norm scores based on random samples with varying sizes either with a conventional ranking procedure or SPCN. The norms were then cross-validated by using an entirely representative sample of N = 840,000 for which different measures of norming error were computed. This process was repeated 90,000 times. Both approaches benefitted from an increase in sample size, with SPCN reaching optimal results with much smaller samples. Conventional norming performed worse on data fit, age-related errors, and number of missings in the norm tables. The data fit in conventional norming of fixed subsample sizes varied with the granularity of the age brackets, calling into question general recommendations for sample sizes in test norming. We recommend that test norms should be based on statistical models of the raw score distributions instead of simply compiling norm tables via conventional ranking procedures.},
