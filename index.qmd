# Welcome {.unnumbered}

The Neuropsychology Team at NHS Combined Healthcare welcomes you to the Functional Neurological Disorder course.

This course aims to provide you with some information about FND whilst you are on the waiting list to see a psychologist.

The course will help you to understand [Functional Neurological Disorder]{style="color: #e60073;"} (FND) and teach you skills to manage your symptoms.


# How to Use This Workbook

The course is split into 11 modules. Each module should take around [15 minutes]{style="color: #e60073;"} to read and complete. We encourage you to complete one module per day.

The course can also be shared with family members or carers if you think it might be helpful for them too.

You will be able to print pages from the modules to write your answers to any exercises in the boxes. If you canâ€™t print the pages, then we recommend that you have a pen and paper to hand as you complete the modules. This is so that you can complete the exercises and make notes of anything you find important or useful.
