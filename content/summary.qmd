# Summary {.unnumbered}

Thank you for completing the course. We hope that you found it helpful.

A summary of the key points that we have covered:

-   FND is a condition where there are changes in the functioning of the nervous system (the brain and the spinal cord).

-   There is no structural damage in FND, making it different to a neurological condition.

-   There are lots of different functional neurological symptoms, but these are either psychological or physical.

-   People develop FND because of psychological, biological and social reasons. You can think of these on a timeline:

    -   Things that have happened before your symptoms started
    -   Things that have happened at the time of your symptoms starting
    -   Things that have happened since your symptoms started

-   Fight, flight and freeze comes from caveman times. Cavemen needed to identify threats to keep them safe. Fight, flight and freeze are responses to a threat. We still have these threat responses today. Functional neurological symptoms happen when we experience the freeze response.

-   The traffic light zones:

    -   Red zone: freeze (functional neurological symptoms)
    -   Amber zone: fight or flight
    -   Green zone: feeling rested and relaxed

-   Thoughts, feelings, behaviours and body sensations happen in every zone, even if you don’t notice them. Becoming aware of thoughts, feelings, behaviours and body sensations can take practice but will get easier the more you do it.

## Staying in the Green Zone:

-   **Breathing skills:** Awareness of your breathing Diaphragmatic (belly) breathing Square breathing

-   **Relaxation skills:** Being in the present moment Progressive Muscle Relaxation Body scan The Five Senses Smartphone apps

-   **Psychological strategies:** Understanding your thinking (not fighting or flighting from thoughts / ‘worry period’) Understanding your behaviour (goal setting / pacing / time not task)

-   **Everyday Lifestyle Habits:** Making one small change to food / drink / movement / sleep / substance misuse / prescribed medication habits (seek further advice from your GP if you are unsure)
